Links:                                                                                     

    {{  Linking to other nodes 

        To make a link, use the right angle bracket (>) followed immediately by a node ID. Press Shift-Ctrl-/ on a line containing a link to open the node with the linked ID. If the linked node is inline, Sublime will jump to and center its starting point. 

        Note that Urtext reads node regions on every save, so cursor location may be imprecise if the file has been altered since the last save.

        Linking does not require a filename, only a Node ID. Any other information around the Node ID (such as the rest of the filename, or arbitrary text), will be ignored. See >00r for more information on file naming and Node IDs.

        {{  Sublime Text tools to help with linking    
            Two Sublime Command Palette commands can make linking quick and easy:
         
            Urtext : Link To ...
                Links from the currently viewed node to another node which you can select in the selection panel. When you select a node in the quick panel, a link to that node will be inserted at the cursor.
     
            Urtext: Link From ...
                Links TO the current node FROM another node. When you select this command, a link to the current node will be copied to the clipboard. You can then paste the reference into the node you open in the quick panel.
                
                                                                                            /-- ID:00m --/ }}

File-Level Nodes                                                                                  

Text is kept in nodes. Nodes can be any length. Think of a node as a blank piece of paper, or a blank region of paper, either one with flexible length.

A file-level node is a node that is identifiable as a single file. A node can be a file but a file can also contain multiple nested nodes. In this system, it's clearer and more useful to think of text regions as nodes than as files.

To create a new empty file-level node press Control-Shift-; (Control-Shift-semicolon). The file is created and named automatically. It has whitespace on top and a metadata block at the bottom containing a node ID, a timestamp showing the creation date and time, and an empty `tags` key.

By default, the first non-whitespace line of any node is the node's title. Write a title and anything else into the node. Save it with Super-S as usual.

Press Control-Shift-E or select "Urtext: Node Browser" from the Sublime command palette (Shift-Super-P) to browse the nodes in the project. In the Node Browser, nodes are sorted by their time of creation, with most recent first. They can also be sorted by index (see >00z). You can find a node by typing part of its title. Open a node by selecting it and pressing return.

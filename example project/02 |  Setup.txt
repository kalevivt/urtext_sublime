Setup

{{  Making an Empty Project

    To make an empty project, make a new empty folder and open the folder in Sublime. Select `Urtext: Init Project` from the Command Pallette.

    You don't need to define a Sublime Project (see https://www.sublimetext.com/docs/3/projects.html), but if you intend to do more than one thing at a time in Sublime, it's convenient to have one; you can then use Select Project -> Quick Switch Project (Ctrl-Cmd-P) to switch among them.   /-- ID:00a --/ }}

 {{ Importing Existing Files

    To import existing plaintext files into this system, some metadata (>00x) must be added containing at least a Node ID. Sublime Urtext can do this automatically by selecting `Urtext : Import Project` from the Sublime Command palette. This will append an `ID` (>01e) and `Timestamp` (>00j) metadata keys and values to the file, along with the current date and time to show when the file was imported.

    Note that the append will occur without a confirmation dialog, so if you are just experimenting with this system, consider making a copy of your file folder so you can revert without having to manually remove the metadata.

    /-- ID:00b --/ }}

Once the package is installed, it will always look for any files with the .txt extension in open folders and attempt to compile them. 

To open an existing folder as an Urtext project in Sublime, just open the folder, a file in the folder, or a Sublime project that includes the folder.

	{{ Syntax Highlighting

			This package comes with a .YML file defining the Urtext syntax, along with two color schemes that provide syntax highlighting. Syntax highlighting makes everything easier by showing depth of node nesting and dimming certain elements of the syntax. Select the Sixteen (for light) or Monokai (for dark) color schemes in Preferences -> Color Scheme ... 

			To avoid having to do this for every file, select View -> Syntax -> Open All with Current Extension As ... -> Urtext. (You can undo this later by repeating the same but selecting Plain Text.) /-- ID: 01d --/}}

	{{	Hiding Tabs

				If you prefer a clean, terminal-like view, hide tabs: View -> Hide Tabs
				This preference can also be set on a per-(Sublime)-project basis. See the Sublime documentation.  

				/-- ID:015 --/ }}

	{{  Hiding Line Numbers

				For an extra-clean look, hide line numbers by adding:

					 "line_numbers": false,

				... to your Sublime project settings file.
			
			/-- ID:01e --/ }}

	{{  Full Screen / Distraction Free Mode

			Since you can navigate entirely from within files, Urtext works great in Sublime's Distraction Free Mode. View -> Enter Distraction Free Mode

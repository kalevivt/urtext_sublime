Node Pointers                                                                 
    
    You can extend trees beyond the file level to create node relationships spanning many files. Preceding a link to a node with two right angle brackets instead of one creates a Pointer. In addition to being a hyperlink, this connects the targeted node, and all of its subchildren, as children of the node containing the Pointer. Example:

        Here is an example Child Node >>001 

    The example Pointer above becomes a child of this node, visible in the table of contents (>01a) or using the other tree views described in >00h.

    The advantages to Node Pointers are many, including:

        - The tree represents a hierachy of actual content, rather than the files containing the content.
   
        - The tree permits nesting both within and beyond file level.
   
        - The tree can be displayed from any arbitrary starting point, whether or not its branches are within or beyond a particular file.

{{  Duplicate Node Pointers 
    
    Node Pointers may point more than once to the same node, so that content can be reused or referenced across multiple trees within the same project:

    Here is the same example child node from above >>001 
    /-- ID:00t --/ }}
    
    Note that a "tree" is a strict hierarchical structure that resolves to a single root.

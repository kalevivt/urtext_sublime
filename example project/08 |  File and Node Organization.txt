File and Node Organization                                                                 
    
    Urtext does not depend on organization of files at the filesystem level. Instead, you can link file-level nodes together in several ways:

    - No subfolder organization scheme. All files are kept in a single folder. Organization of files, file groups, and file relationships is entirely done within the system. This makes it easy to sync and use across devices and platforms where file and folder paths may not always resolve uniformly, and it avoids broken file paths from moved/renamed/reorganized files.

    - Filenaming is arbitrary but can be automated. 
  

    {{ Tree-like: Extending node trees beyond the file level
      
       Nested inline nodes have an inherent hierarchy that Urtext can represent as a tree, as described above (>00i). You can extend this tree either higher or lower beyond individual file level, mimicking file-system organization. Add the metadata tag `parent`, following by a target Node ID. This will link the tagged node to the targeted node in a child-parent relationship. (See >00x for more information on metadata.) The resulting tree relationship(s) will be understood and displayed accordingly by Urtext (see 79810822060133). 

       The advantages here are many, including:
            - The tree represents the hierachy of actual content, rather than the files containing the content.
            - The tree permits nesting both within and beyond file level.
            - The tree can be displayed from any arbitrary starting point, whether or not its branches are within or beyond a particular file.

       Note that a "tree" here is a strict hierarchical structure that resolves to a single root. Therefore, {{nodes can only have one parent (at a time), although multiple nodes may share the same parent. See 79810728091838. /-- ID:00s --/ }} The intended use for this feature is to link separate individual files into trees. Using it in other ways, such as adding a `parent` tag to a inline node that already has a parent, will override this and, while possible, may have confusing results. Instead, see "Virtual Trees" below (79810728091838).
                                                                                            /-- ID:00t --/ }}

    {{  Acyclic or Wiki/Web-like

        Elaborate writing, notetaking, and reference systems are possible by linking nodes together in tangled and intricate ways a tree will not accomodate. To do so, immediately precede a link to a node (see >00l) by the right angle bracket, such as: >>00u. 

        {{  Viewing
        
            While Urtext cannot draw acyclic graphs in plaintext, it can represent these acyclic relationships from the perspective of any one node. Positioning the cursor in the desired node and and selecting "Urtext : Show Linked Relationships..." from the Sublime command palette will open a split view similar to that in 79810822060133. The currently selected node will be displayed as root; all nodes linking into this nodes, and recursively into those nodes, will be displayed above the root; all files linked from this node, and recursively from those nodes, will be displayed below. Circular references are represented up to one iteration.

            Like trees (79810728103313), these diagrams are displayed as Sublime "scratch" views, meaning they will never report as being dirty (unsaved). They are intended for one-time/temporary use and will not update when a node/file changes. To make permanent and dynamically updated diagrams, see 79810911080130.
                                                                                            /-- ID:00u --/ }}
                                                                                             /-- ID:00v --/ }}                                          
    {{ Traverse Mode:                                                    /-- ID:00w; title: Traverse Mode --/

        Once you have a node view, you can navigate it like a file tree by turning on Traverse mode (Ctrl-R). Traverse mode will open a second Sublime pane. As you navigate the nodeview in the left pane with the cursor or mouse, the selected node shows on the right pane. Use Sublime's Focus Group navigation keys, or the mouse, to switch between left and right panes.
        
        The status bar at the bottom of the Sublime window indicates whether Traverse is on or off. Note that if Traverse mode is off, you can also open a link manually (Shift-Ctrl-/) as normal.

Node Metadata

    Metadata tags can be placed anywhere inside the double curly braces of a node. Metadata tags open with a forward-slash followed by two dashes and close with two dashes followed by a forward slash. The syntax is:
        
        <optional key> : <optional value with optional timestamp> 

    Examples:

        /-- Purpose: work-related <Tue., Mar. 05, 2019, 03:25 PM> --/
        /-- kind: gift_list --/

    You can also string several entries together on one line, separated by semicolons:

        /-- note: example note ; tag: groceries --/

    Other than two reserved words (see below), metadata can be have aribitrary keys and values, with open-ended length. Keys and values of metadata tags are indexed automatically and are searchable within the Urtext project. 

    Note that: 

        -   A colon separates the metadata key from the value 

        -   All three components are optional; any content preceding a colon (if one is present) is interpreted as a key; content following the (first) colon is interpreted as a value.

        -   A timestamp anywhere in the value will be indexed as the timestamp for the whole metadata entry. If you put more than one timestamp in an entry, only the first one is indexed.

        -   Indexing of metadata keys and values is not case-sensitive.

    There are two reserved metadata keys:

       {{   title
       
            If for you want to override the automatic title and assign a title manually, use title tag in the metadata block:
       
               /-- title: title (This tag overrides the default title)  --/
                                                                                        /-- ID:00y --/ }}

       {{   index
       
            You can optionally add a two-digit sort index (00-99) to a node, such as:

               /-- index: 03 --/    

            Index tags will sort the files in the node browser (Ctrl-Shift-e). Any indexed nodes will sort before (above) the others, with lowest number appearing first. Remember unindexed notes display in order of creation, newest first. You can give the same index number to multiple nodes; in this case they sort with the most recent node first, within each index.   				/-- ID:00z --/ }}
          
    The only additional reserved metadata keys only apply to the project_settings node (>00l).
                   
                                                                                        /-- ID:011 --/ }}

        To browse nodes using their metadata, use the "Find By Meta" command in Command Palette. Select the tag name and then "<all>" or a tag value. A nodeview matching the selection will be written into a new buffer. }}
